# Rock-Vs-Mine
In the "Rock vs Mine" project, the goal is to predict whether the input coordinates correspond to a rock or a mine, based on a machine learning model. However, before making predictions, the raw data must undergo preprocessing to ensure it is in the right format and optimized for the model. Preprocessing typically involves steps like handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical data, among others. To achieve this, it is crucial to import several important libraries. Libraries such as NumPy are used for numerical operations and array manipulations, pandas for handling and processing structured data, and scikit-learn for tasks like data scaling, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and applying machine learning algorithms. These libraries streamline the preprocessing workflow, making it easier to prepare the data for accurate predictions.
Once the preprocessing is complete, you can then input the coordinates into the model, allowing it to make predictions on whether the given data corresponds to a rock or a mine.
